# Mars-Rover
## Programming test Elo7

The program expects input as follows:

>__5 5__  
__1 2 N__  
__LMLMLMLMM__  
__3 3 E__  
__MMRMMRMRRM__

The first line of input is the upper-right coordinates of the plateau, the lower-left coordinates are assumed to be 0,0. The following input is information pertaining to the rovers that have been deployed, wich gives the rover's position, wich is made up of two integers and a letter separated by spaces, corresponding to the x and y co-ordinates and the rover's orientation. The second line is a series of instructions telling the rover how to explore the plateau and it expects an array of characters, where each character is a command for the robot. 'L' means "turn left", 'R' means "turn right" and 'M' means "move one step towards your direction".

PS: In this solution, if you type 'e' in the deploy of the rovers will stop the execution.
